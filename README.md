Rather than writing descriptions here, the problems are described in their respective headers, with test files
provided for further clarification. As this is an exam, if you ask questions which can be answered by reading
the test files or the project files, I will refer you to those. This is an exam, so late submissions are not
accepted. You should start working sooner rather than later.
Academic integrity will be more strictly enforced on this assignment. Your instructors have been reminded
to remind you that exams which are not group-based should be handled with greater care given the circumstances. FYI, there were submissions of HW3 similar enough that such similarities on this exam would be
turned over to Academic Integrity.
NOTE: There are 18 points on this exam and that is a hard cap. If you earn 19, it is still a
100%. That means you need only solve 3 of the problems for 100% credit. The point allocation is as follows:
• CharMatrix:
1. Compiles: 1 (make test char matrix)
2. Lints: 1 (cpplint –root=./ */char matrix.*)
3. TestFillConstructor: 1 (./test char matrix 0)
4. TestCopyConstructor: 1 (./test char matrix 1)
5. TestAssignOperator: 1 (./test char matrix 2)
6. test char matrix memory: 1 (make test char matrix memory)
• functional array:
1. Compiles: 1 (make test functional array)
2. Lints: 1 (cpplint –root=./ */functional array.*)
3. TestAllocateRectangle: 0.5 (./test functional array 0)
4. TestDeallocateRectangle: 0.5 (./test functional array 1)
5. TestAllocateJagged: 1 (./test functional array 2)
6. TestDeallocateJagged: 1 (./test functional array 3)
7. test functional array memory: 1 (make test functional array memory)
• TightVector:
1. Compiles: 1 (make test tight vector)
2. Lints: 1 (cpplint */tight vector.*)
3. TestAppendEmpty: 0.5 (./test tight vector 0)
4. TestAppendNotEmpty: 1 (./test tight vector 1)
5. TestAppendEmpty: 0.5 (./test tight vector 2)
6. TestAppendNotEmpty: 1 (./test tight vector 3)
7. test tight vector memory: 1 (make test tight vector memory)

• TimeSpan:
1. Compiles: 1 (make test time span)
2. Lints: 1 (cpplint –root=./ */time span.*)
3. TestPlusTimeSpan: 1 (./test time span 0)
4. TestPlusInt: 1 (./test time span 1)
5. TestPlusExtract: 1 (./test time span 2)
6. TestPlusInsert: 1 (./test time span 3)
The End.
